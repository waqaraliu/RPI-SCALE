# RPI-SCALE

This repository is for integrating SCALE hardware with raspberry pi. Which will get the weight of the object placed on it. 
Scale will be connected to RPI GPIO, and samples will be obtained for weight processing, and accurate weight of the object will be logged into the database of choice.

Further instructions will be added in to this repo after starting the project. Day to day commits will be commited regularly so that moderators can pull the repo and can test the application on any of the RPI device.

NOTE:
for running the app, one should have python 3 installed in the home path. As all modules will be python 3 compatable.
